# WordPress Bootstrap Starter Theme

A blank starter theme for WordPress using [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp), [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The only assumption this themes makes is that you want to use Bootstrap. Use as little or as much of the framework as you see fit.
